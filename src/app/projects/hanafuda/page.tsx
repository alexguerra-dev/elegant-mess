                Hanafuda is a traditional Japanese card game. It is played with
                a deck of 48 cards, divided into 12 suits, each representing a
                month of the year. The objective of the game is to collect sets
                of cards and score points based on the combinations you create.

                I really like this game. It is a very visually pleasing game.
                Each card is a flower. There are twelve suits, each representing
                a month of the year. The objective of the game is to collect
                sets of cards and score points based on the combinations you
                create.
