                    Hi! I'm a software developer with a passion for building web
                    applications. I love learning new technologies and improving
                    my skills. I also enjoy drawing and cooking. I am using this
                    webapp as a place for me to learn and expand my skills.
                    Especially in react. I have chosen the NextJS platform for a
                    few reasons. But, the long and the short of it is... It just
                    seems to be easy for me to go from zero to a deployed NextJS
                    app in like 20 min. I think it is super keen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, cooking,
                    playing with my dog. Hanging out with my family. Crafting.
                </p>
