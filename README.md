# Elegant Mess

I am not sure what this is going to be. It looks like it is going to be sort of a test bed for learning React, NextJS, and in general. Software development.

## Getting Started

For development you can start a server with...

```bash
yarn dev
```

You could also use `npm`. I prefer `yarn` I think it is faster. But, I am not really sure that is true.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.
