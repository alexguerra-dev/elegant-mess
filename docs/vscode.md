# VSCode Guide

I added this to my `keybindings.json` file.

```json
{ "key": "a", "command": "explorer.newFile", "when": "explorerViewletFocus" }
```

Now, when I am _focused_ on the explorer I can make a new file with the `a` key.

## Navigating Windows

I can use `ctrl + tab` to do some movement. I am not sure if that is the best way to do it.
